An AI-powered web application that predicts road infrastructure failures such as **potholes**, **road cracks**, and **surface deterioration** using Machine Learning. The system enables citizens to report road issues while providing government departments with an interactive dashboard to monitor, verify, update, and manage road maintenance activities.
